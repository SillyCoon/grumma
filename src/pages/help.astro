      ðŸŒŸ Welcome to our website! ðŸŒŸ<br />
      To fully utilize our spaced repetition system, we recommend the following approach:
    </h2>
    <ul class="list-none grid gap-4 grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3">
      <li class="bg-blue-200 rounded-lg p-4 flex items-center">
        <span class="text-3xl mr-4">&#10140;</span>
        <span>
          If you wish to study a new grammar point, click the <span
            class="bg-yellow-200 rounded px-2">Learn</span
          > button. It will suggest the next unstudied grammar point in order of
          difficulty.</span
        >
      </li>
      <li class="bg-green-200 rounded-lg p-4 flex items-center">
        <span class="text-3xl mr-4">&#10140;</span>
        After carefully reading through the grammar point, click the arrow on the
        right side of the page. You will then be tested once on the grammar you have
        just studied.
      </li>
      <li class="bg-purple-200 rounded-lg p-4 flex items-center">
        <span class="text-3xl mr-4">&#10140;</span>
        Following this short test, the grammar point will be added to your review
        queue.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mt-8 mb-4">
      If you wish to learn more points, simply repeat the same steps.
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      All points studied through the <span class="bg-yellow-200 rounded px-2"
        >Learn</span
      > button will occasionally appear during reviews via the <span
        class="bg-yellow-200 rounded px-2">Review</span
      > button. Therefore, your final step is to do reviews through the <span
        class="bg-yellow-200 rounded px-2">Review</span
      > button as often as possible. Soon, the points for which you provide correct
      answers will appear in your review less frequently!
    </p>
    <p class="mb-4">
      If you want to study certain grammar points intensively, you can navigate
      to the desired point from the start page and click the <span
        class="bg-yellow-200 rounded px-2">Practice</span
      > button. You will receive all available exercises for that point until you
      solve them all correctly. It will not affect your spaced repetition queue.
      Additionally, you can choose several grammar points to practice together in
      the <span class="bg-yellow-200 rounded px-2">Cram</span> section.
    </p>

      We wish you the best on your language-learning journey! ðŸš€
